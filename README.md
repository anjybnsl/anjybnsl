  Hello, my name is Anjali, and I am looking to start a career in data analytics. I am in Accenture training program, a       comprehensive data analytics program from Accenture to learn the necessary skills and techniques for data analysis.
  
  I have completed MCA in June,2023, want to pursuing a career in data science. I always had a strong interest in analyzing data and using it to drive decision-making.
  
  I have hands-on experience with programming language such as Python and its Library. I have completed several data science projects that involved data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, Predictive modelling and data visualization.
  
  My experience in optometry has given me valuable skills such as attention to detail, critical thinking, and the ability to communicate complex ideas in simple terms. I am now eager to apply these skills to the field of data science and contribute to solving real-world problems.
